I'll be going into detail more than I normally do in comments and notes, in an attempt to develop a good habit of it.
It's worth noting that while this text file will offer a lot of guidance around the project, the scripts will have more in-depth comments.

// Brief descriptions of the scripts and their goals
Script description: 

	Voronoi 			- Create and display a voronoi diagram

	MapDisplay			- Collect up all the display scripts into one handy little control script
	MapDisplayEditor 	- Simply just an editor for the MapDisplay script

	CameraMovement		- Controls in-game camera movement

// Showing what scripts link to others and the reasoning behind it
Script links:

	MapDisplay			- Linked to Voronoi for the voronoi diagram
	MapDisplayEditor 	- Linked to MapDisplay as its editor

As I intend this project to have an educational use, I don't mind it being used in non-commercial projects. In fact, I've tried keeping things
as separate as possible for easy use in other projects.
