Written in Visual Studio Code. So there may be weird formatting in other applications.

I'll be going into detail more than I normally do in comments and notes, in an attempt to develop a good habit of it.
It's worth noting that while this text file will offer a lot of guidance around the project, the scripts will have more in-depth comments.

// Brief descriptions of the scripts and their goals
Script description: 

	MapDisplayEditor 	- Simply just an editor for the MapDisplay script.
	MapDisplay			- Collect up all the display scripts into one handy little control script.

	Voronoi 			- Create a voronoi diagram texture.
	PerlinNoise			- Create a perlin noise texture & an array for the map pixel's intended height.
	PerlinColour		- Create a colour texture based on the pixel's given heightMap from PerlinNoise.
	FalloffGenerator	- Create a gradient texture & set the pixel's height level based on the gradient position.

	VoxelMap			- Create a 3D model from the given height-based map options with different resolution scales

	CameraMovement		- Controls in-game camera movement

// Showing what scripts link to others and the reasoning behind it
Script links:

	MapDisplayEditor 	- Linked to MapDisplay as its editor.
	MapDisplay			- Linked to Voronoi for the voronoi distance map & voronoi colour map.
						- Linked to PerlinNoise for the perlin noise map & get perlin noise pixel values.
						- Linked to PerlinColour for the perlin colour map.
						- Linked to FalloffGenerator for the falloff gradient map & falloff pixel height values.
						- Linked to VoxelMap in order to create the 3D mesh of the given map.

	PerlinColour		- Linked to PerlinNoise as it requires the PerlinNoise heightMap values. The value is carried through MapDisplay to allow changes like FalloffGenerator.

	VoxelMap			- Linked to PerlinNoise as it requires the PerlinNoise heightMap values. The value is carried through MapDisplay to allow changes like FalloffGenerator.

As I intend this project to have an educational use, I don't mind it being used in non-commercial projects. In fact, I've tried keeping things as separate as possible for easy 
use in other projects.

I hope you're able to achieve what you're looking for with this!

Sincerely,
