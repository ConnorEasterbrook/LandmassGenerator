# ProceduralMapGenerator
This is essentially just a quick way to generate and display a procedurally generated map onto a gameObject's material in Unity. I have uploaded this because I believe it is a beginner-friendly way to learn procedural generation (since I'm a beginner, have commented like crazy detailing everything in the scripts, and have kept everything separate).
