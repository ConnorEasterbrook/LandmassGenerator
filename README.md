# LandmassGenerator
A procedural map generator in Unity. 

## Description

Designed with the intention of being able to create new maps that can be modified to achieve the user's goal.

## NOTE

Not optimised for large-scale usage at all. This project was developed a while ago before other projects took away my attention.

## Getting Started

To open this project, simply extract it from its downloaded .zip file and use Unity to open the project folder. Unity will do the rest.

### Dependencies

* Tested and functioning on Unity version 2020.3.24f1

## Help

If Unity is crashing then reduce the set map size and uncheck 'autoUpdate' in gameManager.

## Version History
